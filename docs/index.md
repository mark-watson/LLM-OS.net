# LLM OS Experiments

This web site contains isdeas and code by Mark Watson (and hopefully more contributors once this project gets started).

My initial inspiration from this project comes from Andrej Karpathy's video on YouTube [Intro to Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g) and specifically his overview diagram for a LLM OS:
