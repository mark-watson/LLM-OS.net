Mark Watson's ideas for implementing an LLM OS

## Documentation Web Site

The documentation for my LLM OS project is in the subdirectory **docs**
and can be accessed with the domain [https://LLM-OS.net](https://LLM-OS.net).

## Source Code

I am doing preliminary development in a private GitHub repository. When I have
code that is worth sharing it will be moved to the subdirectory **LLMos**.
